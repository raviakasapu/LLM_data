7491727,"This is the UK edition of Dr. Omit's book. Dr. Omit's book, especially when he writes about vitamins and supplements, reads like a secondary school homework done by a lazy student.If I was his teacher I would give him a big zero.This book omits essential information from its readers making the book very unreliable and definitely not worth ordering.The core of this book is its critic to supplements but the author presents very incomplete and misleading data inhis attempt to discredit supplements whilst praising pharmaceutical drugs.The author pretends to be some kind of good medical samaritan but the mediocrity of his research and his very misleading information about vitamins and supplementswill do more harm than good to people who read this book. This book is  a wolf in sheep's clothing.If you are looking for a book about the safety and efficiency of supplements then try \Complementary and Alternative Health: The Scientific Verdict on What Really Works\""",,researchers from John Hopkins School of Medicine evaluated nineteen studies involving more than 136,
002782683X,"This is a fun and entertaining book about learning to work together and share. It is repetitive and easy to follow, so very young children can participate in the reading too. I have a copy of it with an old narration set to music that makes it even more enjoyable. I wish the recording was still available!",6/25/12 0:00,Michelle,5

60392452,"Received this book as a Christmas present. I had seen his film Bowling for Columbine so I knew more or less what to expect. Moore's books and films are anything but neutral or journalism in the ordinary sense, they are Moore's perspective and opinions and if you agree with him then Moore rules - but if you don't, he can be pretty infuriating.I've been involved in several heated debates regarding the issues he raises and know first hand how many of Moore's assertions are real hot buttons for some Americans.  I recommend this book to any thinking person - especially Americans - would don't mind having their assumptions challenged...it can be liberating.",8/5/03 0:00,Challenges your assumptions,4

2311216,"I agree with those reviewers that believe that this is not Agathat's best work, far from it. Her foray is mystery and this books attempts to be a thriller, which doesn't work at all. I cannot say that the writing is bad but this entire book is just not interesting. Her other books that have to do with world organizations are much better although also couldn't be compared to her regular setting of a family murder. So much of the plot just doesn't make sense and apart from the three main characters everyone else remain hazy, which is never the case in any of her other books. I have the entire collection and must say that this is her most unsuccessful literary attempt.",6/12/04 0:00,Not a Thriller,2
25853503,"Then I watch American Masters (PBS) featuring author Margaret Mitchell and was fascinated by her life story.  So I logged on to Amazon and purchased the Kindle edition.  The book is everything I remembered and more.  Especially after seeing the movie, &#34;Lincoln&#34;, I realize how many references to the Civil War were pretty much on target in Mitchell's book.  The characters are so real, alive, and vividly described, I cannot help feeling I am there taking it all in.  When I first read the book, I was like Scarlett, so bored with the talk of war.  Now over 50 years later, I am fascinated to read about the Southerners' opinion about the war before it started and when the battles begin.  GWTW is a great book.  Read it and you will agree.",4/28/13 0:00,First read GWTW when I was in high school.  Saw the movie many times.,5
